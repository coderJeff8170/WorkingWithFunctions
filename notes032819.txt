if you accidentall create a repo on Github without a readme file and have trouble pulling
create a local repo file, git add readme.txt then push.
Git needs a branch and a branch can only be had with a file

The above can be done just like save, stage, commit, push in the regular manner, so long as 
you are connected to GIThub

add "function" to the list of data types

OMG USE THE DEBUGGER TO STEP THROUGH THE PROGRAMS!!!!!
